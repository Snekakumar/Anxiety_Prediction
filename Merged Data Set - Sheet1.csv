It freaking works man. After doing the cognitive part of CBT for a little while I really started to notice some changes. The classic negative thinking that comes from SAD starts becoming less and less powerful as you do the assignments that are given to you each session. And the cognitive assignments aren't even hard. It just took me like 30 mins each day to complete them.
 

 I used to be really anxious in the past, not being able to walk out of my own home without being terribly anxious, to someone who can pretty much function quite well socially in general.
 

 I actually haven't done much of the behavioural portion of the therapy. That's because I slacked off towards the end but also because I lost some motivation to keep going. Also, the behavioural part is a bit scary, obviously, because you're starting to purposely put yourself in anxiety provoking scenarios. I should really pick the therapy back up and destroy those final bits of SAD with the behavioural portion of it.

Just talking about your problems to a listening ear isn‚Äôt productive for changing in the long term.

You have to do modules and homework which feels weird at first but it works if you stick to it and be honest with yourself.

From what I see most everyone here is of a similar age group which is nice, so hearing input from likeminded individuals of nearly the same age is nice.
 

 So I'm 17, and have been worrying about quite a few things in relation to my future. I've narrowed it down to around three topics that trigger my anxiety/depression/whatever the most. Those are:
 

 1. Fear due to not knowing what my future holds, no drive of what to do as a profession, etc
 2. Being scared I will not get married before ~30, which is a life goal of mine (if possible without rushing anything, but my main fear lies in just not finding someone who loves me back). 
 3. Being ""locked"" in my current social situation, not doing anything meaningful, or having anything to look back on.
 

 The thing that is tricky is each of these things happens to be rooted in another, leading to a sort of ""feedback loop"". Because a solution for one thing presents a problem for another. For example, let's choose #2. When it comes to finding someone, let away marrying them, that requires being social, confident, etc. Which are all things I struggle with. That said, I am making an effort to change that, but my opportunities are limited due to me going to a small school, and having a hard time knowing where to go to find new friends IRL. Online it's much less of an issue. 
 

 Lately, I've just been waking up every day feeling sad, lonely, and all of those other buzzwords that I won't list LOL. Even sleep isn't a break anymore, as I tend to dream about my anxieties. It just feels like everywhere I look, and every solution listed, there is a barrier for one reason or another. If anyone wants to talk, I'm happy to go into more detail, but that's the brunt of it.",ÊïèÊÑü„Çµ„É©„É™„Éº„Éû„É≥#3306,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/369547956472250378/933778321173520464/unknown.png,R/SocialAnxiety,Y,Y,N,N,N,Y,N,3

Keep it friendly and polite, but ask them questions about how they like working there, questions about the job in general and be curious. It will make you stand out amongst other candidates.

This way we do not overlook large damages that we might inflict on ourselves and other people. However, when those more fundamental things are not at much risk, I think that fear and anxiety often does get us to be too caught up in the potential bad outcomes, when they are not really too too bad in a larger perspective. Fear and anxiety can blow these negatives out of proportion. So, in my view, it is very useful to get yourself to always try to have a perspective where you can more accurately weigh is really important and what is not so important in the grander scheme of things. Something to note is that this is just an idea I have come up with recently but I haven't really tested it or put it into much use.",Foster#0820,,R/SocialAnxiety,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,0

I actually wanted to ask about something that i've been thinking about... I went to a psychologist and she diagnosed me with social anxiety and depression and said we'll have to start psychotherapy! When i went back to her to start it she told me what's been bothering me and i told her that i can't seem to find motivation to do anything lately not even my favorite hobbies (i used to be very active) however the way she answered made me kinda mad idk she said '' well with this cold no one seem to be able to do anything and she laughed '' and that triggered me so much bcs 1-m telling you a big issue about my life why are you laughing and 2-why are you telling me we all have the same issue while i see most people still doing what they enjoy! Also she told me as a 1st treatment to go to a vendor and ask him many questions but then not buy anything which is something i already can do... I don't know if it's normal for her to say this or it was really not professional! What do you guys think i should stay with her or stop seeing a psychologist...

 i kinda have trouble speaking to people, and I basically started my a-levels around the time the pandemic started, so I wasn't able to make many friends IRL since I live in the middle of nowhere and most of my teaching was done online. i'll be moving to london next year and living by myself in uni, so I'm aiming to hopefully improve on myself and start being able to speak to people without getting nervous and stuff like that. <:taiga:616045770843357231> 
 

 i'm not sure if its social axiety, but I basically just get stressed when speaking to people, and I like have to repeat what I wanna say in my head before I say it otherwise i'll jumble it up, and after speaking for a while i feel like... my stomach has butterflies or something lol. I'm able to speak to people at a store or if I need to call someone from customer service etc. totally fine. I think maybe I speak super fast sometimes since I try to get it over with but yea.
 

 I've tried using my mic in online games but it just stresses me out, and I feel like it doesn't help much.
 

 any help or tips would be appreciated, tho I assume the main thing would be for me to just talk to people more since I assume that'll help haha",,,R/SocialAnxiety,Y,N,Y,N,N,N,N,1

 I lived out on the country as a kid. The nearest town with anything to do in would take me nearly an hour to reach on bike, exhausted. Always wished I could go to the pool or visit the library, explore the place and see what it had to offer. It made it incredibly difficult to get any real social experiences, and it kinda added up over the years. 
 

 They would sign me up for stuff like a scout's club or kid's gymnastics (early years ofc), but never really ask me what I actually had an interest in doing. It was always presented as ""Those are the options."", at least that was the impression kid me got. So I internalized that there was never anything to do, or anyone to be with.

 I personally believe mine was caused by a ""trauma"", like they were just two letters but those two letters really had the strongest impact on my life, and will have it for the rest. I was just in first grade and asked if I could play with some kids, she literally said ""no"" and from that moment I kinda started becoming aggressive and nervous.
 Later in the years I've developed a very avoidant behaviour because I believe people don't enjoy my company so whenever there's a group of people I even know I just go and mind my own business cause I am always feeling like I am disturbing someone there, and the expression on their faces has never convinced me. That's why I barely have friends, I am scared to approach but if people start a conversation with me I will probably keep it going very easily cause I usually open up fast with people, even if I don't know them, and then comes and awkward silence but at moments I can still be able to break it.

I'm not 100% sure I have social anxiety; e.g. I'm okay with 1-on-1 conversations, generally don't feel nervous and don't dread speaking in front of people. However, I struggle a lot with channeling my thoughts and it takes a VERY long for me to form sentences. This may sound weird, but e.g. when talking to my wife, I often just stop talking mid-sentence for 5-10 seconds to figure out what I want to say next. She understands and it's fine. However, when talking to others my mind I don't usually have this luxury so my mind often draws a blank, I just don't know what to say and I get very nervous/anxious, e.g. sweating, shivering, trembling voice, face gets red. I partially deal with this by being extremely prepared (as in, in work meetings I will often just read bullet points I put down on a text file beforehand). Whenever any kind of improvisation is needed though I just can't keep up. It's not anxious > mind draws a blank, it's mind draws a blank > anxious. Once there's a 2-3sec gap where I can't think of what to say next, the anxiety kicks in and there's just no way for me to save things. Worse in larger groups of people because I feel the standard is higher and everything I say must be spot-on and relevant. Just curious if anyone has had any similar experiences?",bowlasaurus3000#2159,,R/SocialAnxiety,Y,N,Y,N,N,N,N,1

I‚Äôve been suffering from social anxiety and depression for years and that made it very hard to make and keep friends. I have always avoided Instagram/Snapchat for privacy reasons (social anxiety) and never had much of a social media presence, but I now feel like this was a huge mistake because I lost contact with people I once loved to be around with. I am alone and do not have any friends or acquaintances I can talk to now, and my social anxiety keeps getting worse. Is it weird to follow people I met and talked to in real life 2, 3, or even 8 years ago? I know I should have just added everyone in the moment, which would have made it much easier to reconnect with former friends and acquaintances, but I never even thought about that in the first place. Many people seem to have established social circles and keep up with each other to this day on these apps, but I have missed that train and I feel like it‚Äôs too late now. Reconnecting with people after such a long time just seems insanely awkward and I am just too scared to add people on Snapchat or push that ‚ÄúFollow‚Äù button on Instagram, especially since they will see that I have 0 posts and no other followers. I‚Äôve bought fake followers just for the purpose of concealing the latter, but once people follow me, they will probably realise this and think something along the lines of ‚Äúwhat a weirdo, all his followers are fakes/bots‚Äù, making things even more awkward. This is all my fault, I messed up. I really wish I could turn back time, get my social anxiety under control, and add those people in the moment. Had I done that, it would have been a lot easier and less cumbersome to reconnect with them via PM, or by passively engaging with them by liking their posts.üò¢",haritakurdu#9623,,R/SocialAnxiety,Y,N,N,Y,N,N,N,2

I'm proud of myself for getting through the day despite making a lot of mistakes. I keep reminding myself why I'm there and my goals. Still, I always end up feeling sick or crying or throwing up. The staff are not intentionally trying to make me feel uncomfortable, but they do get awkward when I mess up in front of them. I really am doing my best, and the only way to get better is putting myself out there. I just didn't realize how traumatic the process is. Every night I cry and I get panic attacks and can't get enough sleep for the next shift. It's like an endless nightmare. I just want this phase tk be over with. I want to know if there's anyone out there who also experienced panic attacks while trying to grit through socializing themselves. I can't be the only one.
