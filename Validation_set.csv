It freaking works man. After doing the cognitive part of CBT for a little while I really started to notice some changes. The classic negative thinking that comes from SAD starts becoming less and less powerful as you do the assignments that are given to you each session. And the cognitive assignments aren't even hard. It just took me like 30 mins each day to complete them.
 

 I used to be really anxious in the past, not being able to walk out of my own home without being terribly anxious, to someone who can pretty much function quite well socially in general.
 

 I actually haven't done much of the behavioural portion of the therapy. That's because I slacked off towards the end but also because I lost some motivation to keep going. Also, the behavioural part is a bit scary, obviously, because you're starting to purposely put yourself in anxiety provoking scenarios. I should really pick the therapy back up and destroy those final bits of SAD with the behavioural portion of it.

 Perhaps you feel the same way, you said you want to have everything together by the end of high school
 It sounds like you were struggling for years with social anxiety, it might take a while to get better and that's okay

And seeing all my friends sosialize so effectively makes me feel like shit. I dread the smallest things even playing video games with my friends gives me anxiety.

Just talking about your problems to a listening ear isnâ€™t productive for changing in the long term. I do CBT and itâ€™s helpful to have a therapist to keep you on track and show you your own progress when you feel like shit. You have to do modules and homework which feels weird at first but it works if you stick to it and be honest with yourself. Youâ€™ll have to do behaviour experiments and things like that to help you put into practice the theory of what you know of social anxiety. 
 Hope that helps!",Domi#2558,,R/SocialAnxiety,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,0
